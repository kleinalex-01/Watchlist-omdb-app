# Movie Watchlist rework

  Reworking this project from scratch, using React + TS.

# Log 1 (2025.06.24.)

  Deleted the old files entirely. Using VITE for the build. Set up file-structure, names, routing. Forgot to commit.

# Log 2 (2025.06.25.)

  Created and worked on the Header component of the application. 
  Added a working light-dark mode properly with context. Also, saved it in localStorage for better practices. Next up is the UI.

# Log 3 (2025.06.25.)

  Added background image, fixed the UI and type safety issues with ThemeContext.

# Log 4 (2025.06.26.)

  Small UI work on the input field and messy fast fetch to test everything. Created context for shared state (watchlist).

# Log 5 (2025.06.27.)

  Major work on the UI and functionality. Custom classnames aside bootstrap in order for the themes to work. Imported shared state from Context where needed, and hooked up the buttons with the neccessary functions.
